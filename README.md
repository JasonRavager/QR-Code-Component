## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most important learning I've got from this challenge is deploying in Vercel since it is my first time to do so. The first time I deployed, the CSS was not working and the images was not loading. I then had to tweak the addresses in my index.html.

From this:
```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/dist/css/styles.css">
```
to this:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/styles.css">
```

Although both codes work in my localhost, the former does not in Vercel App.
